This is a basic markdown document, that can still use latex math like $\alpha$
and $\beta$. It also has automatic formatting for lists:
+ this is an item
+ this is an item, too!

Importantly, it can have headings that look nice in vim
-------------------------------------------------------

And super large headings too!
=============================

You can make headings in other ways though, too. For example, consider the
following subheading.

# This is a heading
## This is a smaller heading
### This is a tiny heading

Notice how all of this looks nice in vim as well as in the pdf, whereas in
LaTeX sometimes you get so bogged down in the syntax that your .tex document
doesn't look all that pretty at all.
