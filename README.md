Programming Help Sessions
=========================

Here are some guides (and other useful things) for programming and Linux,
targeted at physics majors. Let us know if you want to contribute to them. If
it is your first time programming, take a look at README.md in the [Week
1](week_1) directory.

If you're following along with Programming Help Sessions @ UCSB, take a look at
our curriculum for:

-   [Week 1](week_1/) -- interact with the command line, type in vim, and read
    text files
-   [Week 2](week_2/) -- make a simple python file in vim and execute it in the
    shell, learn more advanced command line tools, and parse a computational
    chemistry supercomputer program
-   Test item

Older curriculum:

-   [Spring 2018](spring_2018)

We have guides for:

-   [Linux shells (terminal)](shell/)
-   [Python programming language](python/)
-   [Vim text editor](vim/)
-   [Linux program configurations (dotfiles)](dotfiles/)

We are always looking to improve! Look at our [TODO](TODO.md) page and let us
know if you have additional ideas or would like to contribute to our
documentation.
