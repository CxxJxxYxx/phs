Programming Help Sessions
=========================

Here are some guides (and other useful things) for programming and Linux,
targeted at physics majors. Let us know if you want to contribute to them. If
it is your first time programming, take a look at README.md in the [Week
1](week_1) directory.

If you're following along with Programming Help Sessions @ UCSB, take a look at
our curriculum for:

-   [Week 1](week_1/) -- interact with the command line, type in vim, and read
    text files
-   [Week 2](week_2/) -- make a simple python file in vim and execute it in the
    shell, learn more advanced command line tools, and parse a computational
    chemistry supercomputer program
-   [Week 3](week_3/) -- learn how to write and use bash scripts, customize
    your shell environment with a .bashrc, learn how to compile simple LaTeX
    files in the command line
-   [Week 4](week_4/) -- streamline your editing of LaTeX files with a .vimrc,
    use markdown to seamlessly create attractive documents and websites, and
    add helpful functions to your .bashrc
-   [Week 5](week_5/) -- log into a remote server with ssh, create your own
    github repository, and contribute to these Programming Help Sessions with
    git

Older curriculum:

-   [Spring 2018](spring_2018)
-   [Fall 2018](fall_2018)

We have guides for:

-   [Linux shells (terminal)](shell/)
-   [Python programming language](python/)
-   [Vim text editor](vim/)
-   [Linux program configurations (dotfiles)](dotfiles/)

We are always looking to improve! Look at our [TODO](TODO.md) page and let us
know if you have additional ideas or would like to contribute to our
documentation.
