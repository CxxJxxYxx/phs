Programming Help Sessions
=========================

Here are some guides (and other useful things) for programming and Linux,
targeted at physics majors. Let us know if you want to contribute to them. If
it is your first time programming, take a look at README.md in the [Week
1](week_1) directory.

If you're following along with Programming Help Sessions @ UCSB, take a look at
our curriculum for:

-   [Week 1](week_1/) -- interact with the command line, type in vim, create a
    simple python file in vim, and modify an existing python file in vim.
-   [Week 2](week_2/) -- learn more advanced command line tools and personalize
    your user experience with a `.vimrc` and `.bashrc`
-   [Week 3](week_3/) -- create a document, presentation, and resume in LaTeX
    with vim, compile these files into pdfs in the command line and by
    customizing your `.vimrc`
-   [Week 4](week_4/) -- create markdown documents and convert them into Word
    or LaTeX or html or whatever else, read a solution of the travelling
    salesman problem in python, and parallelize it for use on a hypothetical
    supercomputer

We have guides for:

-   [Linux shells (terminal)](shell/)
-   [Python programming language](python/)
-   [Vim text editor](vim/)
-   [Linux program configurations (dotfiles)](dotfiles/)

We are always looking to improve! Look at our [TODO](TODO.md) page and let us
know if you have additional ideas or would like to contribute to our
documentation.
