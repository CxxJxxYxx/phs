Programming Help Sessions
=========================

Here are some guides (and other useful things) for programming and Linux,
targeted at physics majors. Let us know if you want to contribute to them. If
it is your first time programming, take a look at README.md in the [Week
1](week_1) directory.

If you're following along with Programming Help Sessions @ UCSB, take a look at
our curriculum for:

-   [Week 1](week_1/) -- interact with the command line, type in vim, create a
    simple python file in vim, and modify an existing python file in vim.
-   [Week 2](week_2/) -- learn more advanced command line tools, personalize
    your user experience with a `.vimrc` and `.bashrc`, and generate a python
    file working in a streamlined workflow

Topics we have guides on:

-   [Linux shells (terminal)](shell/)
-   [Python programming language](python/)
-   [Vim text editor](vim/)
-   [Linux program configurations (dotfiles)](dotfiles/)
