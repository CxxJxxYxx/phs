Programming Help Sessions (PHS): Week 2
=======================================

Welcome back!

If you were here last week and you have already cloned the github repository,
you can update the phs directory with all of my new updates by navigating to
the `phs` directory (by **c**hanging **d**irectories with `cd phs`), and then
running `git pull`. This command 'pulls' any updated files from the github
repo into your own personal computer. Now, if you list the files (`ls`) in this
directory you should see a new `week_2` folder. Move into this directory.

Before we get too involved, let's take a moment to recap what we learned last
week. Move up to the parent directory and then into the `week_1` in one
command, with `cd ../week_1`. Be sure to tab complete! In the `week_1`
directory there are cheatsheets for the shell and for vim. Let's open and read
through the shell cheatsheet with `vim shell_cheatsheet.md`. Close the file in
vim with `:q` or `:q!`. Now open and read through the vim cheatsheet file. Now
move back to the week_2 directory with `cd ../week_2`.
